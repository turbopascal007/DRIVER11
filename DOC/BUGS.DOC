Known bugs
==========

Since introduction of new dynamic task daemon following flaws exist:

- When one player has yet a task running, it is quite possible a new
  task for this player will not execute correctly. Some errors in
  recognizing variables might occur, causing the task to exit.
  Maybe not all taskinfo is correctly allocated?
