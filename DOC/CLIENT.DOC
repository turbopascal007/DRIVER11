CLIENT:  A serial line client
=============================

1. How to use it
----------------

If you are on a computer that is linked to another computer that has
the driver running on it, you can use the client to log on to the
driver via a serial line.


2. How to get it up and running
-------------------------------

You have to provide a client.ini file, which will set up a serial line.
Without this file, nothing happens.

In this file, you have to set at least one line that contains
the following:

com <port> <baudrate> <parity> <databits> <stopbits>

where:

port is your comport number 1-4
baudrate is a baudrate in one of: 110, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 2400,
                                  4800, 9600, 19200, 38400
parity is one of: n (none), e (even), o (oneven)
databits is your number of databits 5-8
stopbits is your number of stopbits 1-2

You also have to add/edit a line in driver.ini on the drivers' host
computer that defines the same baudrate, parity, data and stopbits
on the comport that has the connection with the client computer.
(see driver.doc)


3. Test your connection
-----------------------

You can test your connection by starting up a client on as well the
client computer as the host computer. Be sure all parameters are
the same in both ini files (except for the comport eventually)
This way you can quickly determine what baudrates your ports can handle.


4. Advanced mode
----------------

4.1  What about it?

When you just start up the client and use it, it will just act as
any terminal program (although those may require more sweat to get all
parameters right)

This client also supports multiple logons on one serial line! In order
to be able to do so, it will need to go in a special mode, in which
the client really starts talking to the driver. This mode will be
enabled by pressing the <Escape> key after starting up the client.

You have to set up this mode by adding as many lines in your client.ini
as you want players in the following format:

window <topx> <topy> <botx> <boty> <backgroundcol>

Be sure that the next input the driver expects at the moment of
pressing the <Escape> key on the serial line is the name of the player,
since the handshaking is done by the client logging in as the player
'client' with password 'client'.

You can switch windows with F1, return to terminal mode with <Escape> and
abort all contact immediately with 'Ctrl-F1'. Note that you can quit,
but not relogon in a window (you can of course in normal terminal mode).


4.2  How does it work?

It's the most easiest protocol you can imagine. Try your terminal mode
or program to see what happens. After logging in as name: client, code: client,
driver will respond with 'driver:hello', notifying that a client player has
been set up with only 2 special commands:

<player> <command>  :   act as if <player> has typed <command> on his prompt
                        (instead of the client who is the 'actual' player)
client <player>     :   add a new player to the game with name <player>

All output that is sent to a player that has logged on via the client <player>
command will be preceded by his name, so the client will know where to
send this output to a this side of the line, for example

<player> Jack tells you: hi there, player via the client!

Easy uh?


5. Notes
--------

The client should be used for direct links, and then you always have
to try the highest baudrate possible, for all comports 9600 is save,
38400 is worth the try.
The client can also be used for modem links, in which case you have
to give modem commands for dial etc. by yourself and conform the ini
file to your modems' capacities. This will also work for the advanced
mode, you can use the <Escape> key again to leave the protocol mode,
so you can hang up your modem.

The client will never abort, if not done manually by Ctrl-Break.

The driver accepts the client|client logon also from local windows, but all
clients are then redirected to disk. Use this for testing purposes
without a serial link.
