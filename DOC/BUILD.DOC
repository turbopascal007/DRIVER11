BUILD: A virtual drive world builder
====================================

1. Why use it
----------------

This builder can help you create a virtual world of the structure
of your drive. This means you can walk through your directories the
same way you walk through rooms.

In order to accomplish this, the builder will scan your drive and
create a roomfile for each directory it encounters, thereby setting
up exits to every subdirectory and an exit to go to the parent directory.


2. How to use it
----------------

When finished, you can go to the first room (the 'entrance') by loading
the roomfile '1.dir' in the directory where the builer has put the created
files. From there on, you can walk through your drive.

Of course, for more specific applications, you have to modify the files
yourself, since only a small generic description is generated for each
roomfile, and you may want to cross-link directories through the world.


3. The parameters
-----------------

Usage:  build <directorytree>

where <directorytree> = The path you want to be build by the builder
                        Be sure to include complete drive specification, e.g.
                        build c:\        will build tree from root directory
                        build c:\player  will build the player directory
                        build .          will build the current directory

The output files are put in the same directory as build is called from!
