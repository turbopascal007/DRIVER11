Internal driver commands
========================

1. How to use them
------------------

In the game world files you can use them everywhere within a verb
declaration. For example, if you want the command 'l' to call the
internal driver command 'look', add this to an appropriate object:

verb l
  internal look
endverb

If you want to pass the parameter that is given on the commandline
to the internal command, use the % character as in:

verb goto
  internal goto %
endverb
