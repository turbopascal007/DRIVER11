LOAD:  A game world file loader
===============================

1. Why use it
-------------

When you have created a unit file, you will have to wait until the
driver loads your file at some point in the game world to see whether
you have made an error or not.

You can overcome this by forcing the specific file to load from within
the game world with the command 'load'. However, you still have to start
the whole driver in order to be able to use this command.

The game world file loader is an extraction from this command for the
DOS command line. It works internally the same as the world internal
command, but without starting up the whole driver.

With this utility, you can check all of your game code, including the
main settings like windows and comports. It will report all errors
found and at termination a status report of created objects.

! Note that, all code within verb declarations will be taken for granted
! at all load times, since that code can only be executed at runtime.
! Even then, errors will never cause the command to fail, but are dumped
! to the runtime error file.


2. The parameters
