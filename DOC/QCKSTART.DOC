Quickstarting the Game Driver
=============================

A.  You have the complete package including a lib directory with examples:

 1. Be sure you have a directory structure like this:
       . ---|--- BIN
            |--- LIB        (necessary to run the _example_ world)
            |--- DOC        (not necessary)
            |--- SRC        (not necessary)

 2. CD to the BIN directory and type 'driver'

 You are up and running!



B.  You want a minimum configuration to run or make a lib of yourself:

 1.  Make sure you have the following files:
          driver.exe
        ( driver.ini  -> you have to create/edit it yourself )
        ( player.ini  -> you have to create/edit it yourself )

 2.  Touch driver.ini (i.e. create it)

 2.  Start player.ini with the 'unit player' line


 The driver is runnable now.. abort with Ctrl-F1


 3.  To be able to logon, define a logon in driver.ini with 'window' or 'com'

 4.  To have an environment, load in driver.ini a room with the 'load' command

 5.  To have some commands to type, define them in player.ini with 'verb'


 This is the essential base to set up a playable game world!


 6.  To move player.ini and all world files to a seperate directory, set it
     in driver.ini with the 'dir' command

 7.  Further references in the other doc files...
